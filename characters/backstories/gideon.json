    "name": "Gideon \"Cog\" Harrowfeld",
    "backstory": "Once a brilliant artificer and master alchemist, Gideon Harrowfeld spent decades working in secret for powerful factions. His inventions and alchemical research shaped wars from the shadows, but he was never a public figure—only a whisper in intelligence circles. \n\nOfficially, Gideon ‘retired’ after a devastating incident that resulted in the deaths of several high-profile figures. In truth, he went underground, crafting a new persona: a bumbling, senile old man obsessed with tinkering. Under the guise of 'Ol’ Cog,' he reintegrated into society, positioning himself as a harmless eccentric. \n\nDespite his cheerful demeanor, Gideon remains a ruthless strategist. He is currently operating as an infiltrator for a rival faction, tasked with subtly disrupting the party’s progress without exposing himself as an outright threat. Every misplaced tool, every potion that fails at the worst time—it’s all carefully orchestrated misdirection. \n\nBut does Gideon still believe in his cause? Or has he played his role as ‘Ol’ Cog’ for so long that he’s begun to lose himself in the act?",
